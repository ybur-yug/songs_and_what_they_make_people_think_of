## Songs

### Fortunate Son - CCR

Whenever I hear this song I'm reminded why people are OK with gratuitiously loud sound systems blaring on back roads made of dirt being traversed by Jeeps. Possibly while waving American flags, and having asked someone to hold your beer(s).

### Scenic World - Beirut

I worked with someone I'll call V who loved this song so much that its forever beaten into my head as a rad tune. Well sold, V.

### Wild Night - Van Morrison

I bagged groceries a couple years during high school and they had an oldies playlist. I would always get super amped if this came on in time with the end of my shift on any day I was doing something with my friends after.


### Not Alone - Matt & Kim

This one makes me think of my friend H because shes super awesome but has a rough life lately and we listened to this and it cheered her up, and thats hard to do so it made me really happy.
